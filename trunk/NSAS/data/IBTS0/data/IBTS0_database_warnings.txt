
Data issues of IBTS0 database

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains information regarding completeness and known issues with the data in the IBTS0 database.
The information below has been gathered from Herring Assessment Working Group reports and through 
scrutinising the data. The issues are listed by year. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Specific problems by year:

1977	No length measurements for Scottish records

1978	No length measurements for Swedish records

1979 – 1982	No known data issues.

1983	The north-western part of the North Sea was not sampled by IKMT hauls in 1983. 
	The 1983 survey data may therefore underestimate the overall distribution in this year.

1984 – 1991	No known data issues.

1992	Most countries in the IYFS deployed the recommended Methot Isaacs-Kidd (MIK) trawl instead of 
	the traditional IKMT. The MIK has a fixed opening and a sampling efficiency close to 100 % 
	(P. Munk, pers. com). This allowed for absolute estimate of abundance to be made from this 
	point forward.

1993 – 2001	No known data issues.

2002	Data was not available in 12 standard rectangles because of low gear catchability in the Dutch 
	part of the IBTS. The Dutch data was not used in index calculation and excluded from data base. 
	French data missing entirely.

2003 – 2009	No known data issues.

2010	The Dutch 2010 sampling was not included in the index calculation due to outstanding low catches 
	and uncertainties about gear catchability and calibration. The Dutch data is also not included 
	in the database.

2011	Due to research vessel problems, the Swedish sampling in the Skagerrak-Kattegat area (IIIa) was 
	not carried out this year and the index values were consequently calculated without information 
	from IIIa. Also beware of this if looking at distribution of larvae that this means no sampling 
	was carried out in IIIa.

2012	Due to mechanical problems the Norwegian part of the survey was delayed two weeks.
